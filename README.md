📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects

Welcome to this repository! Here, I will be uploading various Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects, where I analyze datasets to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. The goal is to understand data better through visualization, statistical summaries, and preprocessing techniques.

🔍 What You’ll Find Here

🛠 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.

📊 Visualization of Key Trends & Distributions – Using graphs and plots to explore data patterns.

📈 Statistical Summaries & Insights – Extracting meaningful insights from datasets.

📝 Well-Documented Python Notebooks – Easy-to-follow Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step analysis.
